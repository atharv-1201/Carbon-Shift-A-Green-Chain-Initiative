# Carbon Shift: Trade Carbon Credit for prosperous and sustainable growth
Blockchain-Powered Carbon Management leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, automate carbon credit systems, and facilitate carbon trading using XRC-20 tokens. The platform incorporates AI-driven predictive analysis for future emissions, token pooling, and a rewards system to incentivize participation. With a user-friendly interface, it promotes compliance with environmental regulations while increasing public awareness about carbon credits. By revolutionizing emissions management, this approach paves the way for a more sustainable future, offering real-time tracking, decentralized marketplaces, and incentivized contributions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

# Problem Identified
The total CO2 emissions produced by their operations, particularly from factories, can help management devise strategies to reduce emissions and earn carbon credits from the government. Carbon credits are tools designed to lower greenhouse gas emissions. A marketplace exists for trading carbon tokens, but there is a lack of transparency in transactions for the public. Additionally, there is insufficient awareness and utilization of CO2 carbon credits.

# Solution Developed
Carbon emissions from different industries are securely recorded on the XDC Blockchain EVM, offering enhanced transparency and stability. An automated credit system is implemented to help reduce these emissions. To manage carbon credits effectively, the XRC-20 Token (GCT) was created for carbon trading. Salient Features include:

- Verifed KYC Verification Process (IPFS)
- Carbon Decentralized Marketplace
- Automated Carbon Credit System
- AI Predective Analysis of future Co2 Emsision Data
- Realtime monitoring and tracking of Co2
- Individual can contribute and get rewards
